# Boo BC

This chapter is about Boo BC, the bytecode for the programs used in
big-boo proofs. This bytecode is used as an equivalent representation
to the binary circuits that we create proofs for, and is an integral part
of how the library works.

This chapter contains:

- An overview of the design rationale for the bytecode
